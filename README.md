Zoom University is lame and I'm tired of not being able to go out, so now I'm learning how to make Android Apps!

Why make TrackMe? - I wanted an easy and convenient app to track my workouts because I didn't like all the clutter that many of the other workout tracking apps have. (Hopefully, I finish this by the time its safe to go to the gym properly)

This is still a work in progress, but I'll show some previews even though no one will probably see any of this.
